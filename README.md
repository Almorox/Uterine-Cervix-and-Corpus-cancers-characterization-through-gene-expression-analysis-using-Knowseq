# Uterine-Cervix-and-Corpus-cancers-characterization-through-gene-expression-analysis-using-Knowseq

This repository collects the code used for the work "Uterine Cervix and Corpus Cancers Characterization through Gene Expression Analysis Using the Knowseq Tool".

- Folder Healthy_CervixTumor_CorpusTumor: contains files related to the characterization of healthy, cervical cancer and uterine corpus cancer samples.
  - Preprocesamiento_CERVIX_CORPUS_HEALTHY.Rmd: document developed for preprocessing gene expression quantification data related to cervical cancer or uterine corpus cancer patients, considering the classes "HEALTHY", "CERVIX_TUMOR" and "CORPUS_TUMOR". The data was obtained from TCGA (through the GDC portal). This document produces all the R objects that the Clasificaci贸n_CERVIX_CORPUS_HEALTHY.Rmd document takes as input.

  - Clasificaci贸n_CERVIX_CORPUS_HEALTHY.Rmd: document developed for gene expression analysis in the classes of interest. It includes the identification of DEGs, the analysis of the three feature selection methods, the implementation of cross-validation using kNN with different numbers of genes, and the generation of graphical information.

Folder CervicalAdenocarcinoma_CervicalSquamousCellCarcinoma: contains files related to the characterization of cervical adenocarcinoma and cervical squamous cell carcinoma samples. Additionally, it includes the classification experiment of a mixed sample (adenosquamous) into one of these two histological types.
Preprocesamiento_ADENO_SQUAMOUS_ADENOSQUAMOUS.Rmd: document developed for preprocessing gene expression quantification data related to cervical cancer patients, considering the classes "ADENO" and "SQUAMOUS". The data was obtained from TCGA (through the GDC portal).
Preprocesamiento_cervix_ADENO_SQUAMOUS.Rmd: document developed for preprocessing gene expression quantification data related to cervical cancer patients, considering the classes "ADENO", "SQUAMOUS" and "ADENOSQUAMOUS". The data was obtained from TCGA (through the GDC portal).
Both the objects produced by the Preprocesamiento_ADENO_SQUAMOUS_ADENOSQUAMOUS.Rmd document and by the Preprocesamiento_cervix_ADENO_SQUAMOUS.Rmd document are taken as input by the Clasificaci贸n_cervix_ADENO_SQUAMOUS.Rmd document.

Clasificaci贸n_cervix_ADENO_SQUAMOUS.Rmd: document developed for gene expression analysis in the classes of interest. It includes the identification of DEGs, the analysis of the three feature selection methods, the implementation of cross-validation using kNN with different numbers of genes, and the generation of graphical information.
